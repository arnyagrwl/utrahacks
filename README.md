# utrahacks

We made a robot with Arduino Uno to address 3 challenges:
1. The first challenge is to grab a flag and drop it in the center of coloured rings.
2. The second challenge is to navigate a maze with walls and randomly-coloured tiled floors.
3. The third challenge is to navigate a maze with directions encoded into coloured floor patterns.

It integrated 3D printed arms controlled by a servo, an ultrasonic sensor to measure its distance from the walls, a colour sensor to detect colours on the floor, and a motor driver with 2 DC motors to make the corresponding turn.
