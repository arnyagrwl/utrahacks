# utrahacks

We made a robot with Arduino Uno to address 2 challenges. The first challenge is to grab a flag and drop it in the center of coloured rings. The second challenge is to navigate a maze with walls and coloured tiled floors. It integrated 3D printed arms controlled by a servo, an ultrasonic sensor to measure its distance from the walls, a colour sensor to detect colours on the floor, and a motor driver with 2 DC motors to make the corresponding turn.
